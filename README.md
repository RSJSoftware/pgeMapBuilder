# pgeMapBuilder
A tile based map builder utilizing the olcPixelGameEngine.

This was a personal project, and my first piece of software in c++.
It was built using the olcPixelGameEngine and can be used to draw maps for 2-D olcPixelGameEngine based games.

olcPixelGameEngine can be found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

I would like to add more to this project in the future, including more safety checks, smoother drawing, and smoother camera movement.
However, in its current state it can be used to create functional double layered maps with a flag on each tile.
