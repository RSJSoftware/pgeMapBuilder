# pgeMapBuilder
A tile based map builder utilizing the olcPixelGameEngine.

This was a personal project, and my first piece of software in c++.
It was built using the olcPixelGameEngine and can be used to draw maps for 2-D olcPixelGameEngine based games.

olcPixelGameEngine can be found here: https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine

I would like to add more to this project in the future, including more safety checks and smoother camera movement.
Also, currently all assets need to be located within the same directory, I would like to fix this in the future, to allow for maps, tilesets, and the built in assets to be saved in separate folders.
However, in its current state it can be used to create functional double layered maps with a flag on each tile.
